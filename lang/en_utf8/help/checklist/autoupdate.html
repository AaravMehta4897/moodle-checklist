<h2>Check-off modules when complete</h2>
<p>This will automatically check-off items in your checklist when you complete the relevant activity in the course.</p>
<p>'Completing' an activity varies from one activity to another - 'view' a resource, 'submit' a quiz or assignment, 'post' to a forum or join in with a chat, etc.</p>
<p>For details of exactly what causes an activity to be marked as 'complete', ask your site administrator to look in the file 'mod/checklist/autoupdate.php'</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> this will only work if your site administrator has made a slight change to one of the files in the Moodle install. Full instructions for doing this can be found in the README.txt file included when this plugin was downloaded</p>
