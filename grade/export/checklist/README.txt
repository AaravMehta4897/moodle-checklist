This is a grade export plugin which will create an Excel spreadsheet containing all the checkmarks from a single checklist.
You can customise the included fields by editing the included file 'columns.php'.

It will not work without the checklist module - which can be downloaded here: http://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=mod_checklist
